Skin-Cancer-Diagnosis (DeepLearning)
## Introduction:
Skin cancer is a disease that occurs when abnormal skin cells grow out of control. It's the most 
common cancer in the United States. Skin cancer is caused by damage to skin cells, which can 
be caused by:
• Ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun, tanning beds, or sunlamps
• Unrepaired DNA damage
Skin cancer can develop on skin exposed to the sun, but it can also occur on areas of skin not 
normally exposed to sunlight.
A dermatologist can diagnose skin cancer with a skin biopsy. A skin biopsy is the only way to 
know for sure if someone has skin cancer. In this procedure, the dermatologist removes a sample 
of suspicious skin for lab testing. The biopsy can determine if someone has skin cancer and what 
type of skin cancer they have. Because of the high occurrence of skin cancers AI/ML models of 
cancer diagnosis are becoming more powerful tools for dermatologists. 

## Dataset description:
Skin tumors image dataset holding 10015 images is available in Harvard.edu Dataverse as described below:
1- Number of cases: 10015.
2- Number diagnosis classes: 7
3- Patients ages ranges from 1 to 85
4- Patients sex: Male: %54.0, Female: %45.5, and Unknown: %0.5
5- Image resolution is width: 600 pixels and height: 450 pixels.
Objective:
This study intended to offer a practicable deep learning-based method for the skin cancer analysis 
in lesion images, to help physicians in diagnosis
